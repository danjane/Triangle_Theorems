\textbf{How should we find patterns in the data?}

\

Assume data from a triangle stored in a row of matrix $M$ and that $M$ is extended with a dummy column of ones. Then we are looking for the `simplest' solutions to 
\[ Mx = 0. \]
Simplest translates as the sparse non-zero solutions, i.e.
\[  \min \|x\|_1, \qquad Mx = 0, \quad \|x\|_2 = 1. \]
To remove the second constraint and find all relations, we can loop over the coefficients of $x$ setting each to one. For example with $x_1 = 1$ and writing $M = (c\, | A)$,
\[  \min \|x\|_1, \qquad Ax+c = 0. \]
